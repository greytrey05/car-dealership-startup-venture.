# car-dealership-startup-venture.
Mini project where I am a data analyst for a startup called "Venture".
The investors want me to find out which cars are most popular with customers so they can make sure to stock accordingly. 
In this project, I will work on a dataset store in database of **Venture** and, import the **CSV file**, and use **SQL queries to clean automobile data**.
