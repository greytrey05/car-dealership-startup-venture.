# Introduction
Mini project where I am a data analyst for a startup called "Venture".

# Business Task

1) Clean data using SQL
2) The investors want me to find out which cars are most popular with customers so they can make sure to stock accordingly. 

I will work on a dataset store in open-database [automobile](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile), import the **CSV file**, and use **SQL Bigqueries to clean automobile data and get it ready for analysis**.
