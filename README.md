# Introduction
Mini project where I am a junior data analyst for a startup called "Venture".
One of their client a renting car company want to find out what cars are among the most popular in their car park.
Jerry the manager of the analyst team at **venture** assigned me to clean the dataset using Biguery SQL

# Business Task

1) Clean data using SQL
2) The investors want me to find out which cars are most popular with customers so they can make sure to stock accordingly. 

# About the data
I will work on a dataset store in open-database [automobile](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile), import the **CSV file**, and use **SQL Bigqueries to clean automobile data**.

I used the SELECT Fonction and, to complete my task:
- DISTINCT
- MIN,MAX
- UPDATE
- IS NULL
- COUNT
- DELETE
- LENGHT
- TRIM

I created a Viz of the new cleaned dataset where executive can view the the details of their park [Viz_Cleaned_data]( https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/james.trey/viz/MiniprojectVenturecarpark/Tableaudebord1).

I also used chatgpt as I was curious about what cars was popular at that time in 1985-1987 here's what I got as a result if I had to go through the 6 step of a data analysis:

"the most popular cars in the United States were typically mid-size or compact cars. The Ford Taurus was the best-selling car that year, followed closely by the Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry. Other popular cars included the Chevrolet Celebrity, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, and the Ford Escort.

In terms of body style, sedans were the most popular, followed by coupes, station wagons, and hatchbacks. SUVs were not yet as popular as they are today, and most were larger, truck-based vehicles rather than the crossover SUVs that are common today.

It's worth noting that the preferences for cars can vary widely depending on factors such as region, age, and socioeconomic status, so these trends may not have been true for every individual or group in the United States."
